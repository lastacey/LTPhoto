This README assumes that the user already knows how to use git and unzip a zipped file folder.

To run this program, clone a copy of the repo to your desired destination.  After the clone has completed, navigate to the LTPhoto directory in a terminal or command prompt. If you are running a Linux or Mac OS, enter `./gradlew build` at the command line, or, if you are running a Windows OS, enter `gradlew build` at the command line, to test, compile and produce the application. 


After the gradle build process has completed, navigate from LTPhoto to the build\distributions folder. Unzip the LTPhoto.zip file folder to a desired location.  Within the unzipped file contents, navigate through the subfolders to `\binâ€™ folder.  Execute the LTPhoto.bat file (Windows) or LTPhoto shell script (Linux/Mac) to start the program.


Follow the directions inside the application to display the photo ids and titles with an album or to quit the application.
